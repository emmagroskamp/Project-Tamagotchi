# Project-Tamagotchi

For project Tamagotchi I created a Tamagotchi, also known as Polite Cat (may he rest in peace), for users to take care of. 

The point of this application is to keep the Tamagotchi alive and healthy as long as possible. The longer you keep it alive the higher your score gets. 
Besides, no one likes to see the sad pictures in the picturebox of Polite cat, right? 

To keep your Tamagotchi alive all you have to do is feed it and give it enough water, so that their hunger- and thirstbar doesn't drop. 
Once the hunger- or thirstbar drops the health of your Tamagotchi drops as well. The lower it gets, the higher chance your Tamagotchi ends up getting sick and eventually die.

If the health in the healthbar drops, but you filled up both progressbars (for food and drinks), the healthbar will remain stable and won't drop any longer. 
Which gives you more time to gain some more points.
